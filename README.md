### How to Use

This assumes Python is called with the `python` command. If you run python with `python3`, substitute with that.
- Make sure you have Python >3.10 installed: `python -v` or `python3 -v`
- Install the requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- TBD (command may change): Run the app `python run.py`
